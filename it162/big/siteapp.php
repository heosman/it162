 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be successful with your company or business, you need to make sure that you 
     choose the best way to put it out there to your audience. The fact is that your only choice
      isn’t just making a website. The alternative is creating a mobile app. There are benefits 
      and cons to each option but there are seemingly more benefits with creating a mobile app 
      over a responsive website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While mobile apps might keep users limited to a mobile device to access a company’s 
    interface, it is wise to consider that users spend much more time on mobile apps rather than 
    mobile websites. According to studies, users spend almost 90% of their time on mobile devices 
    on apps and only around 10% of their time on browsers.[1] If you want more interaction with 
    users, this is something to keep to keep in mind when it comes time to choose.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile apps offer much more convenience and ease to access than a website to users. 
       Once you download the app, all you need to do is click on it whenever you need it. Meanwhile 
       a website requires you to search it up. Mobile apps typically offer more features than a 
       website also. You can get push notifications from the app for important updates and other 
       alerts. This captures the attention of the users and ensures they check your app often. Other 
       features are using your phone’s camera as a QR-code reader or the application knowing your 
       location to give you a more relevant experience. A mobile app can also direct you to other 
       apps quickly and efficiently.[2] </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another benefit to using a mobile app rather than a website is that mobile apps 
        typically work faster than websites and you can offer an offline mode. Having offline mode 
        is convenient for a user in the case of having slow or no internet connection instead of 
        having a website that is completely down for them.[1] </p>
