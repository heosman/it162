 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the reasons that people create websites is to bring awareness to their business 
     or make money in some way. That’s where monetizing your website comes in. There are 
     various approaches and methods to monetize your website but before you attempt to do 
     that, there are steps you should take that will help you in getting the customers necessary 
     to successfully earn money from your website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something to remember that successful monetization doesn’t come easy. Time, effort, 
    and maybe even money need to be invested in order to reach your goal. After creating 
    and setting up a website, you should learn about search engine optimization and make 
    sure your website takes that into account so your website is able to gather an audience 
    and increase traffic. You should also try to engage with your target audience by gathering 
    an audience on social media, increasing your website’s email list subscribers, and etc [1]. 
    Doing these things ensures that you are monetizing your content for an existing audience 
    and that you aren’t investing into nothing. There’s no point in putting ads if no one’s 
    watching them right?</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to monetize your website is through affiliate marketing. This means partnering 
       up with other businesses so that you earn a commission every time someone is referred. 
       You should be careful though before promoting too much or unrelated products and services 
       can make your audience think you are insincere [1]. Another method is selling a product 
       or service relevant to your website. A common option is digital goods because it doesn’t 
       require as much effort and maintenance as physical products. Having a paid subscription 
       on your website is also something to consider, whether it be a subscription to your mailing 
       list, the website itself, or for a service you are providing. Another method is Google adsense 
       and selling ad space [2]. With Google adsense, you would allow Google to put relevant ads 
       on your site and get paid for each click on an ad. Selling ad space is basically allowing 
       other companies to sponsor you and put ads on your site for a price.</p>
